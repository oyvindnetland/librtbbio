# librtbbio

Library for easy use of the GPIO and PWM (and possibly more later) RTDM drivers for Beaglebone Xenomai 3.

Library is fully working, but not test program. Only GPIO input (connect two GPIO, and the input read the value of the output) is currently implemented.

Should consider to use a unit test framework for test application.
